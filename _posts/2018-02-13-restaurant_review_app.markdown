Everyone has to eat and would like to be able to find a good restaurant. There are plenty of different apps out there that people use to rate restaurants; but for this project I have decided to make my own. I went into this app wanting to make it so you would not need to make a username to search the restaurants. But if you want you could create a username and then find a restaurant that you went too and make a review for it with a rating from 0 to 5. 
Once of the hardest parts of this project was decided how I was going to implement all the different functions that I wanted this site to have. One such example is when I was making the OAuth log in when I already have the normal secure log in created. I was already using the sessions controller for the log in function of the normal secure log in. So, I decided to create a different controller to put my OAuth logic in. The experience of being able to make decisions like this in my code while being difficult was also one of the aspects I enjoyed the most about this project.
